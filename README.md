# Halloween Jack-o-Lantern Pumpkin 
## With LED Lights and Fog effect

In this project we are going to carve a Halloween pumpkin and add some LED lights.
To make it even more dramatic we add a fog effect with an ultrasonic mist manufacturer.
We also add an Arduino controlled fan to push the fog out of the pumpkin every 5 seconds.

This repo will include all the 3D printing files and code needed to re-build this project ind the **/stl** folder.
